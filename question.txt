Objective:

HackerNews (https://news.ycombinator.com/) is very popular website among developers for latest news and projects. However sorting of the items is done via their own algorithms and we want to build a clone which keeps getting the top 90 articles and shows them in reverse chronological order. 

Requirements:

1. Each news item will have the following fields - url, hacker news url, posted on, upvotes and comments. 
2. A script which crawls the first three pages, extracts the news items and adds in the database. If the news item already exists, it updates the upvote and comment counts
3. A user can signup or login to the dashboard
4. A dashboard where all news items are listed in reverse chronological order
5. A user can mark a news item as read or delete it. Deleted items are not shown in his/her panel but are not deleted from the database.
